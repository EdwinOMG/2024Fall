## About Me
```typescript

I studied at Suny Sullivan Community College for one year and earned my AAS degree in Computer Programming. While there, I took a Projects course and developed an application my professor/advisor suggested to me. 
It was an app that simplified the advising process for advisors, digitalizing the process. Instead of filling out a paper form for each student each semester, this app made it easier and faster for advisors to help students. 
  I see myself greatly benefiting and using what I learn in this course. My goal is to make an eye-catching and well made portfolio after taking this course. 
I also believe the concepts talked about in class will improve my skills as a programmer, whether I work front-end or back-end.
